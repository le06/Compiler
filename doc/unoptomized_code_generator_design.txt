Unoptomized Code Generation Design
----------------------------------

We have designed our low level intermediate representation to be close
enough to machine code to make code generation possible by a single depth-first 
walk of the tree, generating code sequentially to append to the file.

The major design issues focus around control flow and expression evaluation:

Expression evaluation is accomplished using a stack based evaluation system.
We leave the expression tree essentially as is from the high level IR. We give
each subclass of expression an eval() method that operates recursively. Every
eval() method ends by pushing its return value onto the stack. 
	-Binary operators pop the top two values off the stack, evaluate them, and 
	push the return value back onto the stack. 
	-Literals and variables just push a value onto the stack.
	-Methods evaluate all their arguments recursively in reverse order, pushing
	them onto the stack, then move the first six arguments into registers. When
	they return, they pop the rest of the arguments off the stack and push their
	return value onto the stack.

Control flow is handled by reducing control flow statements like if, while, etc. 
into three different types of nodes: labels, jumps, and blocks. An 
block is just a subtree that can be made up of any normal calls. The labels
and jump statements structure the control flow of the program. For example, an if
statement turns into a block with the following nodes:

	Block (containing test), Jump (to label .true), Block (containing false body),
	Jump (to label .end), Label (.true), Block (containing true body), Label (.end)


Here are some other design points we came up with while hashing out
the design:

- Boolean expression trees are left as is -- we create short circuited
  code during the code generation phase

- We use a separate walk of the low level IR to convert all 
  variables to relative addresses

- We transform all -= and += operators to = by altering the expression
  tree on the right side of the expressions

Conversion from Low-Level IR to Assembly Code
---------------------------------------------

* additional primitives like Jump, Label, etc. might be used
*   these primitives make up the fields of the IR nodes
* preserve variable and method identifiers
* reuse/create symbol tables for determining where ids refer to in memory
*   do 2nd pass through low-level IR to determine how to resolve ids
